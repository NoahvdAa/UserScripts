# XenForoNotificationCount

<a href="https://github.com/NoahvdAa/UserScripts/raw/master/XenForoNotificationCount/xenforonotificationcount.user.js" target="_blank">Install</a> [Requires Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey]

This userscript will show you the amount of alerts + unread conversations you have by putting it in the document title.

## Installation

1) Install the userscript using the "Install" button at the top of the page.

2) Go to your userscript manager (Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey) and click "Edit" next to XenForoNotificationCount.

3) Change `// @match        https://xenforo.com/community/*` to whatever site you want to use. For example: `// @match        https://spigotmc.org/*`.

**Important note: some sites don't have their XenForo installation at the home page (/*) so you might need to include the subdirectory first (e.g. /community/*).**

4() Change the userscript name to something that makes this installation of the userscript unique. (So you can install it for multiple sites)
