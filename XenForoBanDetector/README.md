# XenForoBanDetector

<a href="https://github.com/NoahvdAa/UserScripts/raw/master/XenForoBanDetector/xenforobandetector.user.js" target="_blank">Install</a> [Requires Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey]

Shows when a XenForo forum user is banned. (In threads only).

## Flaws

- Users that have their profile page set to private, will also be shown as "banned". There is no way to fix this, since XenForo shows the same page for both.
